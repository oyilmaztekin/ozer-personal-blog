Hi!

I'm a software developer for more than a decade. I am currently working on a frontend focused software restructuring project as a developer consultant. I participated in a lot of projects in a variety of different environments like a government with highly secure environments, banks with complex calculations and transactions, e-commerce websites work under high traffic and more. 

Now I'm sharing frustrating problems I encountered when I rethink something and how I solve them.
